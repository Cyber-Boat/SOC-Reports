# SOC-Reports

This repository serves as a centralized collection of Security Operations Center (SOC) reports documenting real-world–style security incidents, alert investigations, and defensive analysis. The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate practical SOC capabilities, structured incident reporting, and analytical depth across multiple security domains.

The reports contained here reflect hands-on work in:

Security monitoring and alert triage

Incident detection, analysis, and response

Log analysis across endpoints, servers, and network sources

Threat identification mapped to MITRE ATT&CK

Root cause analysis and impact assessment

Actionable remediation and prevention recommendations

Each report is written to mirror professional SOC documentation standards, including clear timelines, severity classification, evidence-based findings, and structured conclusions. Where applicable, screenshots, dashboards, queries, and diagrams are included to support investigative findings
